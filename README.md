This is a Connect-Four game to be played between two local players in the
command line.

This is an assignment from The Odin Project to consolidate the TDD lessons I've
been through. We are going multiple times through the loop of figuring out what
needs to happen, writing the test for it, then write the code to make it pass.

Since the purpose of this is practicing TDD I'll write tests for everything,
maybe even more than would be necessary, all for the sake of learning.
