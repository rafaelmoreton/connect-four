# Connect Four
![Screenshot](/demo/demo-connect.png)

This is Connect Four game to be played between two local players in the
command line. I made it as an [assignment from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four)

## How to play
This game can be played at your own computer's command line interface (CLI) or at an online one, like repl.it.

**Disclaimer:** the online option DOES NOT allow the game to be played between players at different computers across the internet. It simply allows the game to be played at an online browser. 

### Play Online
To play online simply open [this repl](https://replit.com/@rafaelmoreton/connect-four#), click on `run` and wait a few seconds for the game menu to appear

### Play Offline
To play offline you need to have ruby >= 2.7.4 installed. Then simply clone this repo, navigate to it's directory (`cd connect-four`) and run the game (`ruby main.rb`).

## Learning
My purpose with this project was to consolidate the TDD lessons I've had. I
went multiple times through the loop of figuring out what needs to happen,
writing the test for it, then writing the code to make it pass.

Since the purpose of this was practicing TDD wrote tests for almost everything,
maybe even more than would be necessary for the sake of practicing.
